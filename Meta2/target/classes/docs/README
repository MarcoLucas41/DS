### Modules
### They are stored in "lib" folder
### To run the program, the following modules must be added as project dependencies:
### jsoup-1.17.2.jar
### jsoup-1.17.2-javadoc.jar
### jsoup-1.17.2-sources.jar


### For the sake of running the application without triggering warnings, the programs must be run in the following order:
### 1 - UrlQueue
### 2 - RMIGateway
### 3 - RMIBarrel (at least one)
### 4 - RMIClient

### VSCode:
### Go to "Run and Debug" tab on left bar and select the project's folder.
### Create a "launch.json" file, from which build configurations can be set for all components
### (Mandatory): RMIBarrel.java must have an integer as "args".

### RMIBarrel.java
### This component runs with a single argument, working as the barrel's id throughout the application
### Before runtime, set args[0] as an integer; the application will warn if it's an invalid id.

### Configuration.java
### All settings related to the workings behind the application (which involve RMIBarrel, Downloader, RMIClient and RMIGateway)
### are defined and accessed through this class.
### (Important)
### The gateway's IP address must be specified in this class. From the client's side, if the client runs in the same machine as the gateway, set it to "localhost".
### If not, then set it to the IP address of the machine that will be running the gateway (it must be in the same private network).
